For security reasons I would sugges tto setup the vultr VPS with a KEY for SSH instead of a password and to only allow phpmyadmin access from your IP. If you have a static IP. You can even get creative and only allow PHPMyAdmin access from LOCALHOST and use an ssh tunnel with putty.

Once you have the environmetn setup we will start the TUT.
